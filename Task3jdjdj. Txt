2 Introduction
This document outlines the structure and permissions for a Library Management Sys-
tem to be implemented in SharePoint using the JavaScript Object Model (JSOM). The
system automates book management, member management, book issuance/return,
and dashboard functionalities.
3 SharePoint List Structure

5 JSOM Automation Considerations
To automate the tasks using SharePoint JSOM, consider the following:
2
• Book Management: Use SP.ListItemCreationInformation to add new books,
SP.List.getItems with CAML queries to search/remove books, and SP.ListItem.update
for updates.
• Member Management: Similar to Book Management, use SP.ListItem opera-
tions for adding, updating, and deleting members. Use CAML queries to search
by Member ID or name.
• Book Issuance and Return: Leverage Lookup fields to link books and mem-
bers. Use SP.ListItem to record issue/return dates and SP.FieldYesNo for over-
due status.
• Dashboard: Use SP.List.getItems to fetch and display book counts and bor-
rowed book details. Implement client-side rendering with JSOM for real-time
updates.
6 Workflows
The following automated workflows will be implemented using JSOM and SharePoint
features:
• Book Issuance Workflow: When a book is issued, the system updates the Book
Issuance and Return list, sets the Status to "Issued," and calculates the Return
Date (e.g., 14 days from Issue Date).
• Book Return Workflow: On return, the system updates the Status to "Re-
turned" and clears the Overdue flag if applicable.
• Overdue Notification Workflow: A scheduled script checks the Return Date
against the current date. If overdue, the Overdue flag is set to "Yes," and a
notification is logged (e.g., via a custom list or email if integrated).
7 Error Handling and Validation
To ensure data integrity and smooth operation:
• Input Validation: Validate ISBN format (e.g., 13 digits) and ensure Member IDs
are unique using JSOM queries before adding new items.
• Error Handling: Use onQueryFailed callbacks in JSOM to handle errors (e.g.,
permission issues, list not found) and display user-friendly messages.
• Duplicate Checks: Before adding a book or member, query the list to prevent
duplicates (e.g., check ISBN or Member ID).
8 User Interface Considerations
To enhance usability within SharePoint:
3
• Custom Views: Create views in each list to filter data (e.g., "Overdue Books,"
"Active Members").
• Forms: Customize forms using JSOM to prefill fields (e.g., auto-generate Mem-
ber IDs) and add client-side validation.
• Dashboard: Use a SharePoint web part to display the dashboard, leveraging
JSOM to dynamically render book counts and borrowed book details.
9 Assumptions and Dependencies
• Assumptions:
– SharePoint 2013 or later is used, supporting JSOM.
– Users have access to a modern browser for JSOM scripts.
• Dependencies:
– SharePoint JSOM library (sp.js) must be available.
– Proper permissions must be configured as per the permission groups.
