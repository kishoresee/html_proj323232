Thanks for sharing the screenshot. The message:

"Cannot complete this action. Please try again."
with a Correlation ID usually indicates an internal SharePoint error.

Even though the view is created, SharePoint is struggling to complete the render or post-creation action, possibly due to one of the following:


---

Possible Causes & Fixes:

1. set_viewFields() vs ViewFields conflict
In JSOM, if you’re using set_viewFields(["Title"]), don’t include <ViewFields> inside your viewXml string. It causes conflicts.

Fix: Remove this part from viewXml if you're already using set_viewFields():

<ViewFields>
    <FieldRef Name='Title'/>
</ViewFields>


2. Use Either viewXml or Property Setters – Not Both for the Same Values
If you’re passing both set_query(viewXml) and set_viewFields(...), the internal engine can throw a conflict error if the ViewFields overlap or are mismatched.

Fix Recommendation: Either:

Fully define everything in viewXml, or

Use only the set_*() methods and leave viewXml minimal or unset.



3. Permissions Issue
Ensure the logged-in user has Design or Full Control permission to create views on that list.


4. Check Field Internal Name
Make sure you're using the internal name of the fields. For example, if you renamed "Title" in the UI, its internal name might still be "Title".


5. Browser Cache/Script Load Delays
Sometimes, JSOM libraries don't load completely. Wrap your script inside:

SP.SOD.executeFunc('sp.js', 'SP.ClientContext', createAlphabeticalTitleView);

✅ Clean and Safe Version (No conflicts):

<script type="text/javascript">
    function createSimpleTitleView() {
        var ctx = SP.ClientContext.get_current();
        var list = ctx.get_web().get_lists().getByTitle("YourListName");

        var camlQuery =
            "<View>" +
                "<Query>" +
                    "<OrderBy>" +
                        "<FieldRef Name='Title' Ascending='TRUE' />" +
                    "</OrderBy>" +
                "</Query>" +
                "<RowLimit>50</RowLimit>" +
            "</View>";

        var viewInfo = new SP.ViewCreationInformation();
        viewInfo.set_title("Title A-Z Only");
        viewInfo.set_query(camlQuery);
        viewInfo.set_rowLimit(50);
        viewInfo.set_paged(true);
        viewInfo.set_viewTypeKind(SP.ViewType.none);

        var views = list.get_views();
        views.add(viewInfo);

        ctx.load(views);
        ctx.executeQueryAsync(
            function () {
                alert("View created successfully.");
            },
            function (sender, args) {
                alert("Failed to create view: " + args.get_message());
            }
        );
    }

    // Make sure sp.js is loaded
    SP.SOD.executeFunc('sp.js', 'SP.ClientContext', createSimpleTitleView);
</script>

Let me know if the error still appears or if you'd like to log that Correlation ID with SharePoint ULS logs.
