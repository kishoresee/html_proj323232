Here’s a short version you can include in your documentation:

⸻

Overdue Book Notification System (HTML + SharePoint REST API)

A custom notification panel is implemented in the web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system connects to the ‘Books_Issued’ SharePoint list and displays a red badge with the count of overdue books. Clicking the bell icon toggles a dropdown showing member names, book titles, and due dates.

Key Features:
	•	Uses SharePoint REST API to fetch books where DueDate < today and ReturnStatus == 'Pending'
	•	Notification badge (#notifCount) updates in real-time
	•	Dropdown panel (#notifBox) displays overdue entries neatly
	•	Fully built using HTML, jQuery, and CSS

Tip: Ensure SharePoint list columns include BookTitle, MemberName, DueDate, and ReturnStatus for this to work.
